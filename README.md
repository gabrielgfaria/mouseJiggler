# mouseJiggler
A simple mouse jiggler that detects inactivity and proceeds to simulate mouse movements and actions in order to avoid unwanted results from such inactivity. THIS IS NOT, AND NEVER WAS, INTENDED TO FAKE USER ACTIVITY. This was needed to avoid disconnection from a client's VDI when running a very long test
